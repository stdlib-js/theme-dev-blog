# VARIABLES #

# Define command flags:
FIND_MAKEFILES_FLAGS ?= \
	-name 'Makefile' \
	-o \
	-name '*.mk'


# RULES #

#/
# Prints the runtime value of any variable via `inspect.VARIABLE_NAME`.
#
# @example
# make inspect.FOO
#/
inspect.%:
	$(QUIET) echo '$*=$($*)'

#/
# Asserts that a variable is set via `assert.VARIABLE_NAME`.
#
# @example
# make assert.FOO
#/
assert.%:
	$(QUIET) if [[ "${${*}}" = "" ]]; then \
		echo "\nError: You must set the environment variable: ${*}.\n"; \
		exit 1; \
	fi

#/
# Prints a sorted list of Makefile variable names.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   To remove duplicates, pipe to `uniq`.
# -   The list of variables is NOT exhaustive, as the list does not include variables which are built-in. These variables could be included by dumping the Makefile database `make -qp`.
#
# @example
# make list-variables
#/
